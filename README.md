# IBM-ReactJS-E-Commerce-Data-Rendering-Using-React-Toolkit
### Introduction
In this lab, I learnt how to use Redux Toolkit to manage state throughout the entire application in such a way that it can be accessed by any component without following the hierarchy between the components.

I built a simple E-Commerce application using React and Redux where I displayed a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button for each product, displayed the items added to the cart, and allowed users to remove items from the cart.

All this information is going to be globally available throughout the application using Redux Toolkit.

### Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, I was able to:
- Integrate React components with Redux for state management.
- Implement basic E-Commerce features such as adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, and clearing the cart.
- Practice composing multiple React components to build a cohesive user interface.
